## üñã About
Poet's Typewriter is a simple website that showcases a random poem from [PoetryDB API](https://poetrydb.org/index.html) with a typing effect, as if the authors were typing it to you! The purpose of this project is to help people discover new poems an authors and to practice working with API's in JavaScript.

The site was made using Vanilla JavaScript and a lot of love ‚ô°

## üìù Notes
I decided to select only short poems from the api, cause some of them were very long (more than a thousand lines!!) and I found it too tiring to wait for the site to type the whole thing.

You can check the website here.
